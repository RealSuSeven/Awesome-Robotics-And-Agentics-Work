# Autonomous AI Agents
All about Autonomous AI Agents you need are here.

Currently, there are two main directions, LLM-based Agents and RL-based Agents. This repo mainly focuses on LLM-based Agents.

## About Autonomous Agents
**What is Agent?**
Agent = LLM + Memory + Plan + Tool + Neuron + Intuition

**How do agents collaborate?**
Multi-agents = Agents + Environment + SOP + Auditing + Routing + Subscribtion + Economics

**Three Models of Human-AI Synergy**
1. AI Embedded mode: The original task flow remains unchanged, people perform it step by step, and at some point in the middle we stop doing it ourselves and hand it over to the AI.
2. AI Copilot mode: Keeping the original task flow order, AI provides a shortcut to execute the entire task flow at once, and the whole process is transparent, so people can intervene at any step in between.
3. AI Agent mode: People don't care how the task is executed, leave it all to AI.
