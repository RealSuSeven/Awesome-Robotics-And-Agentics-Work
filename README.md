# Autonomous AI Agents
All about Autonomous AI Agents you need are here.

Currently, there are two main directions, LLM-based Agents and RL-based Agents. This repo mainly focuses on LLM-based Agents.

## About Autonomous Agents
**What is Agent?**
Agent = LLM + Memory + Plan + Tool + Neuron + Intuition

**How do agents collaborate?**
Multi-agents = Agents + Environment + Auditing + Routing + Subscribtion + Economics
